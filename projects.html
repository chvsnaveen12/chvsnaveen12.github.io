                Built a computer, a graphics card, a keyboard buffer out of pure
                74HC logic. Wrote my own ISA, Micro-code, Assembler, OS and some
                games. Currently working on adding WI-FI and Sound capabilities.

                We were clearly the fastest and most agile, but due to a
                mechanical failure all hopes came crashing down.

                This was coded overnight, definitely an example of why you
                shouldn't code complex algorithms overnight while being
                intoxicated with caffeine.

            <p class="write">
                I went to a Tech-Expo when I was young. I saw a 3d-Printer and
                totally wanted to build one. I was 13 when I built it and didn't
                have any power-tools or a 3d-printer to help with manufacturing
                of parts , some corners were definitely cut, but it PRINTS. This
                was built under 100$.

                Built a Enigma replica for a school fair, it was an overall
                demonstration of cryptography. It suddenly gathered a lot of
                attention and we got the lucky oppurtunity to display it at ISC.
                There, we even met the Prime-minister of India.

            <p class="write">
                After making my first 3d-Printer, I thought of printing a frame
                for another 3d-Printer and shifting all of the parts, basically
                a total transformation. I built it, but it didn't work well. The
                frame had extreme back-lash, which made it impossible to print
                the first layer.

            <p class="write">
                After having multiple failures at building big RC planes, I
                thought of building a extremely small plane as a POC. I took a
                foam glider of 17" wingspan, and converted it to RC. I had to
                design my own Receiver and Transmitter as weight was a big
                issue. It flew great. Crashed it many times, but it doesn't seem
                to care.

                Instructables held a competition in the LED category. I built
                this to take part. I didn't win, but the build process was super
                fun.
