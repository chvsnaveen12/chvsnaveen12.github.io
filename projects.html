                Built a computer, a graphics card, a keyboard buffer out of pure
                74HC logic. Wrote my own ISA, Micro-code, Assembler, OS and some
                games. Currently working on adding WI-FI and Sound capabilities.

                We were clearly the fastest and most agile, but due to a
                mechanical failure all hopes came crashing down.

                This was coded within a night, definitely a example of why you
                shouldn't code important algorithms overnight.

                I went to a Tech-Expo when I was young. I saw a 3d-Printer and
                totally wanted to build one. I built it within a 100 dollars. I
                was 13 when I built it and didn't have any power-tools or a
                3d-printer to help with manufacturing of parts , some corners
                were definitely cut, but it PRINTS.

                Built a Enigma replica for a school fair, it was an overall
                demonstration of cryptography. It suddenly gathered a lot of
                attention and we got the lucky oppurtunity to show it at ISC.
                There, we even met the Prime-minister of India.

            <p class="write">
                After making my first 3d-Printer, I thought of printing a frame
                for another 3d-Printer and shift all of the parts, basically a
                total transformation. I built it, but it didn't work well. The
                frame had extreme back-lash, which made it impossible to print
                the first layer.

            <p class="write">
                After having multiple failures at building big RC planes, I
                thought of building a extremely small plane. I took a foam
                glider of 17" wingspan, and converted it to RC. I had to design
                my own RX-TX as weight was a big issue. It flew great. Crashed
                it many times, but it doesn't seem to care.
