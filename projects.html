                mechanical failure all hopes came crashing down. Still hurts thinking about how easily it could have been avoided.

                This was coded overnight, definitely an example of why you
                shouldn't code complex algorithms overnight while being
                intoxicated with caffeine.

                I went to a Tech-Expo when I was young. I saw a 3d-Printer and
                totally wanted to build one. I was 13 when I built it and didn't
                have any power-tools or a 3d-printer to help with manufacturing
                of parts , some corners were definitely cut, but it PRINTS. This
                was built under 100$.

                After making my first 3d-Printer, I thought of printing a frame
                for another 3d-Printer and shifting all of the parts, basically
                a total transformation. I was mesmerized by the delta kinematics, it felt like MAGIC. I built it, but it didn't work well. The
                frame had extreme back-lash, which made it impossible to print
                the first layer.

                After having multiple failures at building big RC planes, I
                thought of building a extremely small plane as a POC. I took a
                foam glider of 17" wingspan, and converted it to RC. I had to
                design my own Receiver and Transmitter as weight was a big
                issue. It flew great. Crashed it many times, but it doesn't seem
                to care.
