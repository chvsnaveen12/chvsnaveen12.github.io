                I am Naveen Chavali(in red) a student of 12th and a guy who just
                likes to tinker. I have worked with C++, high performance C,
                Python, Micro-controllers (using register accesses), x86
                assembly, Web-Dev, CAD and 3d-Printers. Due to the pandemic, I
                haven't done much in these past 2 years, but am trying to change
                that as soon as possible. If you'd like to reach out, feel free.

                I was always fascinated by things growing up. I would rip open
                everything in my sight and try to understand how they work, but
                couldn't as they were always too complex. I used to watch people
                build electronic circuits effortlessly using complicated chips
                and components. I was too confused, I didn't even know where to
                start. It all changed when a teacher, came to our society and
                offered up classes for practical electronics. We used to not let
                him go even till 9PM even if the class should have ended at 7PM.
                These classes made me gradually comfortable with electronics.
                After 1-2 years i was able to design and manufacture my own
                designs. Then I found Ben-Eater on Youtube and absolutely got
                addicted to his videos. I always used to wonder how a computer
                functioned from the inside, we were told in school that a CPU
                has an Accumalator, an ALU, some Registers etc. But how did they
                all work? I finally understood 1980s computing standards due to
                Ben-Eater and MITOCW and built a couple of computers equivalent
                to the 1980s standards. And I am trying to continue to grow in
                this field.

                Have I donr things only related to CS? Currently I am interested
                in hardware design, but that doesn't mean I am not trying other
                things as well. I have also tried Computational Fluid Dynamics,
                Hydroponics, CAD and Ultra-sonic arrays, although at a much
                lower level
